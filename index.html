                                            <p>I have worked in the construction industry in one way or another since i
                                                was
                                                15
                                                years
                                                old. I got started
                                                when I needed a summer job and my neighbor's construction company needed
                                                some to
                                                come
                                                clean the sites.
                                                It was the hottest summer I had ever experienced but I was getting paid
                                                two
                                                dollars
                                                over
                                                minimum wage
                                                making me the richest of all my friends. i returned every summer until I
                                                graduated
                                                highschool and headed
                                                off for college. Mississippi State University, I took a job as a server
                                                thinking
                                                this
                                                would be a much
                                                easier job than what I was used to. I realized very soon that the one
                                                thing
                                                that
                                                was
                                                worse than being
                                                hot and outside was getting yelled at about food everyday. Needless to
                                                say,
                                                I
                                                headed
                                                back for refuge at
                                                the construction as soon as summer break began. </p>

                                            <p>I worked every summer break I had for a commercial construction company
                                                as a
